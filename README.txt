Purpose:
Perform parametric and non-parametric statistical tests and examine 
size and power results under a range of different scenarios. Each scenario 
focused on simulating data sets with various attributes, for example, 
increasing Sample Size or Effect Size. The process flow, results from 
computing simulations completed (plots and tables) and outcomes are detailed 
within the paper and fully documented in the project file.

-----------------------------

Solution:
Rshiny application created to enable an interactive, exploratory statistical 
analysis into Power & Size.

-----------------------------

R packages used within the shiny app can be found by opening 
the 'rScripts/global_Libraries.R' file.
All packages referrenced within the final paper.

To quickly run the RShiny Application, if you have set your working 
directory to this current folder './ #~ThisProjectFolderName~# /'
you can run the below code:

source( 'runShinyApp.R' )

which will open the RShiny Application for you.

Process flows and scenario documentation can also be found in 
the 'ShinyApp_Documentation' folder. 


All the best.
